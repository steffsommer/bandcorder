# Bandcorder mobile app

## About

The mobile app can be used to control the recording state of the application.
At the moment, only Android is supported.

## Prerequisites

- `flutter --version` >= 3.0.0
- An IDE (e.g. Android Studio, VS Code)
- Android SDK >= 21 (tested with v35)

## Getting started

- Open the project in your IDE. Your IDE should prompt you whether you want to
  install an Android SDK (in case you don't have a fitting one already).
- Check that flutter is set up correctly:

```bash
   flutter doctor
```

- Afterwards, you should be able to start an Android emulator. The app can be compiled
  and shipped to the emulator when starting the application in `main.dart`.
